# A Case for Bayesian Grading

- <b>Year:</b> May 2024
- <b>Collaborators:</b> Yuxuan Chen, Victor Zhao
- <b>Advisor:</b> Craig B. Zilles, Matthew West
- <b>Tools:</b> Python, Jupyter Notebook

    Research project for CS 500: Topics in Computer Education Research. Simulating student grades
    as bayesian probabilities for analysis on trustworthiness. A combination of proctored (UIUC CBTF) and non-proctored scores were used in the simulation process.
    <i>Accepted to [SIGCSE Virtual 2024](https://sigcsevirtual.acm.org)!</i>

# Optical Music Recognition for LilyPond File Generation

- <b>Year:</b> May 2024
- <b>Professor:</b> Svetlana Lazebnik
- <b>Tools:</b> Python, Jupyter Notebook
- <b>[Paper](/files/cs444-report.pdf)</b>

    Graduate project for CS 444: Machine Learning for Computer Vision. Analysis of state-of-the-art work in
    Optical Music Recognition (OMR) with respect to several digital music notation formats. LilyPond is deemed to be a reasonable format for use in OMR given its current structure and underlying functionality for batch exporting. 

# Nearest Neighbor Classification for Classical Image Upsampling

- <b>Year:</b> November - December 2023
- <b>Collaborator:</b> Nic Prate
- <b>Professor:</b> Paris Smaragdis
- <b>Tools:</b> Python, Jupyter Notebook
- <b>[Github](https://github.com/ematth/KNN-Classical-Upsampling)</b>

    Research project for CS 545: Machine Learning for Signal Processing. Explores the use of K-Nearest-Neighbors Interpolation for the purpose of image upsampling. 
    Implementation expanded to include dynamic aspect ratio upsampling and selective upsampling to reduce computation time for images with solid-color regions.

# Personal Website

- <b>Year:</b> May 2023
- <b>Tools:</b> HTML, CSS, Markdown, Github Pages

    Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and designed using the [XMIN](https://xmin.yihui.org/) theme. Read more about my journey through web development [here](/note/how-i-made-this-website/).

# Senior Capstone: Transcribing Monophonic Audio with Deep-Learning Data

- <b>Year:</b> Spring 2023
- <b>Advisor:</b> Zuofu Cheng
- <b>Tools:</b> MIDI/MusicXML, MuseScore, Python
- <b>[Website](https://singsong.gatsbyjs.io/), [Presentation](/files/capstone.pdf)</b>

    Combined senior capstone project with Kevin Zhou. Our main goal was to implement a machine-learning model for rudimentary conversion of raw audio recordings into readable sheet music. I created the database of examples to be recorded and handled the business side of the study, and Kevin put together the webapp [SingSong](https://singsong.gatsbyjs.io/) for collecting recording data.

# Absentea
- <b>Year:</b> Spring 2022
- <b>Collaborators:</b> Majeed Akinlusi, Zeyang "Hans" Zhang, Kevin Zhou
- <b>Tools:</b> React.js, SQL 

    Final project for CS 411; database webapp designed for comparing schedules and absences between members of an organization or group. Inspiration taken from scheduling sites like [When2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/) and [Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/).

# DISSCO
- <b>Year:</b> Fall 2021 - Spring 2022
- <b>Director:</b> Sever Tipei
- <b>Collaborators:</b> Tejus Kurdukar
- <b>Tools:</b> C++
- <b>[Github](https://github.com/tipei/DISSCO-2.0.2), [Website](https://cmp.ischool.illinois.edu/software/dissco/index.php)</b>

    **DISSCO**, or Digital Instrument for Sound Synthesis and Composition, is a Linux-based program combining music composition and sound synthesis for the easier creation of stochastic and non-stochastic music.

# Disklavier Echo Effect
- <b>Year:</b> Fall 2021 - Spring 2022
- <b>Director:</b> Heinrich Taube
- <b>Tools:</b> Python, [rtmidi](https://pypi.org/project/python-rtmidi/), [musx](https://github.com/musx-admin/musx) 
- <b>[Github](https://github.com/evanmm3/Disklavier-Echo-Effect)</b>

    "This is a course project for MUS 305 at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, under the course direction of Dr. Heinrich Taube. This project aims to simulate an "echo" effect on a Yamaha Disklavier piano, on up to 16 key simulatenously, with repetitions and diminishing of echo sound up to the performer. The program runs using the musx library and uses threading to run real-time outputs to a Yamaha Disklavier."

# Pan-Lang

    *Second prize winner at [PYGHACK 2020](https://pyghack2020.devpost.com/):* a food pantry webapp designed providing translated lists and descriptions to patrons of Champaign and Urbana-area foodbanks. 

# Spotigraph
- <b>Year:</b> Fall 2020
- <b>Collaborators:</b> Beth Fineberg, Cale Wolf, Kevin Zhou
