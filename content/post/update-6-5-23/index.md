> ðŸ’¡ You can read the **bolded sections** of this post to get the TL;DR.

Hey everyone,

I'm proud to announce that my **blog posts now have comments!** You can use this section to leave feedback, continue topic discussions or suggest edits. I only ask that everyone be kind and courteous to each other, (<i>please don't force me to moderate negative/toxic comments or remove commenting entirely</i>).

Additionally, I've replaced the previous "Articles" tab with "Audio Processing" as **I'm starting to make audio processing tutorials.** Articles and papers related to audio processing are scattered all over the place online, so my goal is to create one central reference for the topic. If anyone has suggestions for audio-processing related things they want to learn, (basic audio processing tools, denoising, spatial audio), let me know! These articles should hopefully come out as soon as I get python code embeds running on the website. 

Finally, I'm going to try to set up a subscription system so everyone subscribed can know when I make blog posts, so **be on the look out for a "Subscribe" button within the next month.**
