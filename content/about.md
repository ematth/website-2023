**Evan Matthews** is a computer science graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on audio computing and AI/ML, more specifically the improvement of AI audio generation and lossless translation between sheet music and audio. He is a member of the UIUC CS Audio Lab, under thesis advising from [Paris Smaragdis](https://paris.cs.illinois.edu) and additional research guidance from [Minje Kim](https://minjekim.com/).

Evan picked up interests in music when he began learning to play piano and clarinet at age 12. 
In high school, he participated in the MTHS Wind Ensemble, which performed at the Illinois SuperState Concert Band Festival (2016, 2018, 2019), the Chicago Field Museum (2016), and the Illinois Music Education Conference (2019). He also took second place in the 2018 and 2019 ILMEA Composition Tracks for his solo piano works, and performed with the 2019 ILMEA All-State Band on clarinet. 

Evan continued composing as an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he delved into experimental and computer music, participated in the UIUC Electronic Music Studios (EMS), and studied under [Stephen Andrew Taylor](https://stephenandrewtaylor.net/), [Reynold Tharp](https://music.illinois.edu/people/profiles/reynold-tharp/), [Heinrich Taube](https://music.illinois.edu/people/profiles/heinrich-taube/) and [Eli Fieldsteel](http://www.elifieldsteel.com/). As a graduate student, he continues to compose in his free time, where is focus has shifted to microtonal theory and performance.

    Research project for CS 545: Machine Learning for Signal Processing. Explores the use of K-Nearest-Neighbors Interpolation for the purpose of image upsampling. 
    Implementation expanded to include dynamic aspect ratio upsampling and selective upsampling to reduce computation time for images with solid-color regions.

## Personal Website

- <b>Year:</b> May 2023
- <b>Tools:</b> HTML, CSS, Markdown, Github Pages

    Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and designed using the [XMIN](https://xmin.yihui.org/) theme. Read more about my journey through web development [here](/note/how-i-made-this-website/).

## Senior Capstone: Transcribing Monophonic Audio with Deep-Learning Data

- <b>Year:</b> Spring 2023
- <b>Advisor:</b> [Zuofu Cheng](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/zcheng1)
- <b>Tools:</b> MIDI/MusicXML, MuseScore, Python
- <b>[Website](https://singsong.gatsbyjs.io/), [Presentation](/files/capstone.pdf)</b>

    Combined senior capstone project with Kevin Zhou. Our main goal was to implement a machine-learning model for rudimentary conversion of raw audio recordings into readable sheet music. I created the database of examples to be recorded and handled the business side of the study, and Kevin put together the webapp [SingSong](https://singsong.gatsbyjs.io/) for collecting recording data.

## Absentea
