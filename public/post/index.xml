      <description>CSLSC 2025 I&amp;rsquo;m proud to announce that CSLSC 2025 was a resounding success! This year, I chaired for the Machine Learning and Signal Processing (MLSP) session alongside Asher Mai. Guest speakers included Dr. Cem Subakan from UniversitÃ© Laval, and Ziyang Chen from the University of Michigan. We also had a handful of student presenters, of which included Trung-Hieu Hoang who won &amp;ldquo;best MLSP student talk.&amp;rdquo; Thank you to everyone who presented and helped in the organization process for the conference, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done this without you.</description>

      <description>Life updates Wow, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated my blog in a while&amp;hellip;&#xA;My first year of grad school at UIUC has gone and went, and I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished quite a bit since entering the MS CS program last fall.&#xA;I wrote three research papers related to a variety of topics:&#xA;Nearest Neighbor Classication for Classical Image Upsampling with Nic Prate. We wrote this for a class on Machine Learning for Signal Processing in December 2023, and I was very excited to finally get a paper published (and read by other researchers) on arXiv.</description>

      <description>[[fetch]]&#xD;files = [&#34;./updatecode.py&#34;, &#34;./reunion.wav&#34;]&#xD;Hey everyone,&#xA;My website now has support for Python code using PyScript! This means that, on top of formatting code for LaTeX formulas&amp;hellip;&#xA;sr1, sample1 = wavread(&#39;./reunion.wav&#39;)&#xD;sample1 = sample1[:int(len(sample1)/4)]&#xD;figure, axs = plt.subplots(1,2)&#xD;figure.set_size_inches(18, 8)&#xD;figure.suptitle(&amp;quot;Chopin Op.28 No. 1 \&amp;quot;Reunion\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)&#xD;axs[0].plot(sample1); axs[0].set_title(&amp;quot;Waveform&amp;quot;)&#xD;a = spectrogram(axs[1], sample1, sr1)&#xD;display(figure, target=&amp;quot;plot&amp;quot;)&#xD;&amp;hellip;my website can now show implementations of formulas and display and plot code output! I hope to start using this feature for my future Audio Processing articles by directly implementing Python code into the page.</description>

You can use this section to leave feedback, continue topic discussions or suggest edits. I only ask that everyone be kind and courteous to each other, (please don&amp;rsquo;t force me to moderate negative/toxic comments or remove commenting entirely).&#xA;Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve replaced the previous &amp;ldquo;Articles&amp;rdquo; tab with &amp;ldquo;Audio Processing&amp;rdquo; as I&amp;rsquo;m starting to make audio processing tutorials.</description>

      <title>LaTeX for Note-Taking</title>

      <description>$\LaTeX$ LaTeX, pronounced &amp;ldquo;lah-tech&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lay-tech&amp;rdquo;, is a typesetting system based on the TeX language. It was developed in 1985 by American computer scientist Leslie Lamport, who wrote the package due to his frequent use of shortcuts for mathematical and scientific symbols in his own writing. Since then, it has become a staple in the world of academia as one of the premier document-writing tools with numerous integrations and extensions to the LaTeX package.</description>
