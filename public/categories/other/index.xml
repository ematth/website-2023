      <title>Playing with 4o Image Generation</title>

      <description>OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s newest image generation model has radically change the landscape of AI-generated images, (for better, or for worse). Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;ve acted like a &amp;ldquo;kid on Christmas morning&amp;rdquo; for the past two weeks messing around with this model, and I figured what better than to post my use cases and results.&#xA;For the record: this isn&amp;rsquo;t to start some argument about AI art being slop or conflicting with copyright. I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that, as much as Image generation trivializes the manual work of drawing/painting art, it&amp;rsquo;s by no means a replacement.</description>

      <description>CSLSC 2025 I&amp;rsquo;m proud to announce that CSLSC 2025 was a resounding success! This year, I chaired for the Machine Learning and Signal Processing (MLSP) session alongside Asher Mai. Guest speakers included Dr. Cem Subakan from Universit√© Laval, and Ziyang Chen from the University of Michigan. We also had a handful of student presenters, of which included Trung-Hieu Hoang who won &amp;ldquo;best MLSP student talk.&amp;rdquo; Thank you to everyone who presented and helped in the organization process for the conference, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done this without you.</description>

      <description>Life updates Wow, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated my blog in a while&amp;hellip;&#xA;My first year of grad school at UIUC has gone and went, and I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished quite a bit since entering the MS CS program last fall.&#xA;I wrote three research papers related to a variety of topics:&#xA;Nearest Neighbor Classication for Classical Image Upsampling with Nic Prate. We wrote this for a class on Machine Learning for Signal Processing in December 2023, and I was very excited to finally get a paper published (and read by other researchers) on arXiv.</description>

      <title>Barbenheimer Review</title>

      <description>Barbenheimer Last Friday, I had the pleasure of participating in the Barbenheimer craze, watching Greta Gerwig&amp;rsquo;s Barbie and Christopher Nolan&amp;rsquo;s Oppenheimer. While I don&amp;rsquo;t visit the movie theater often, I found this double feature to be tons of fun, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give my reviews of both movies in the order that I saw them.&#xA;Barbie I went into Barbie with the understanding that I was certainly not the movie&amp;rsquo;s target audience and that a lot of material wouldn&amp;rsquo;t land with me or any of the other males in the theater.</description>
